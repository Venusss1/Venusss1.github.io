            <p>After contacting Yong Du at OUC, I started my first formal research experience around 3D Gaussian Splatting. The initial goal was to understand the paper, rendering pipeline, method flow, and code organization before attempting any innovation.</p>

In November I integrated a new benchmark into VLMEvalKit: preparing TSV files, converting images to base64, uploading data with MD5 checks, registering the dataset, implementing evaluation logic, reusing inference results, and understanding the LLM-based verifier configuration. I later shared the process and pitfalls within the group.</p>

I worked on Culture-domain data, collaborated on game data conversion and checking, fixed unstable evidence chains, and supported music, film, game, and sports samples.</p>

            <p>After a meeting, MotionRAG became the main direction. I studied what the retrieval component retrieves, how motion representations are encoded, and how retrieved priors are injected into video-generation backbones. I prepared MotionRAG + DiT-Mem slides covering LanceDB, gte-base-en-v1.5, top-k retrieval, DINO and VideoMAE features, Action Transformer, CAMA, CogVideoX attention processor replacement, and training settings. Because of compute limits, we chose a strategy of code reading, small-scale pipeline reproduction, and result analysis.</p>

I ran the MotionRAG pipeline and analyzed why generated results were weak: small subset retrieval quality, differences from paper settings, limits of the CogVideoX base model, and coverage of motion priors. I compared action_mae and DINO with paper-side expectations.</p>

            <h4>Shifted toward physics-consistency evaluation and improvement ideas</h4>
            <p>After MotionRAG reproduction analysis, I shifted from asking whether RAG improves visual quality to whether generated videos obey physical laws. I surveyed physical video datasets such as PhysInOne, latent world-model reward, and inference-time physics alignment. I formed the view that generic video data and generic text retrieval are not enough for physics-consistent generation; the retrieval library or training data should encode motion, contact, force, and physical state changes.</p>
